 <h1>meowsey's public computing project</h1>
 <p>i want to find out to what extent it is possible for
 someone to learn web technology and Linux and deploy something
 publicly accessible entirely for free from public machines.</p>

 <p>the goals of the project are:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>spend no money whatever*</li>
  <li>use only public infrastructure, such as library computers</li>
  <li>document and write up everything as i go!</li>
  <li>end up with something publicly accessible, interactive, and
  nice</li>
 </ul>
