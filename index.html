  <h1>meowsey's public computing project</h1>
 </header>

 <main id="main">
  <p>i want to find out to what extent it is possible for
  someone to learn web technology and Linux and deploy something
  publicly accessible entirely for free from public machines.</p>

  <p>the goals of the project are:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>spend no money whatever*</li>
   <li>use only public infrastructure, such as library computers</li>
   <li>document and write up everything as i go!</li>
   <li>end up with something publicly accessible, interactive, and
   nice</li>
  </ul>

  <p>*one of the things i found out quick is that having a usb flash
  drive is pretty much essential since you can't save files on
  the public computers, and although using cloud storage is possible,
  it would make everything so much more slow every day.<p>
