 <main id="main">
  <article>
   <p>i want to find out to what extent it is possible for
   someone to learn web technology and Linux and deploy something
   publicly accessible entirely for free from public machines.</p>

   <p>the goals of the project are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>spend no money whatever*</li>
    <li>use only public infrastructure, such as library computers</li>
    <li>document and write up everything as i go!</li>
    <li>end up with something publicly accessible, interactive, and
    nice</li>
   </ul>

   <p>*one of the things i found out quick is that having a usb flash
   drive is pretty much essential since you can't save files on
   the public computers, and although using cloud storage is possible,
   it would make everything so much more slow every day.</p>

   <h2>background on me</h2>
   <p>i have a technical background, so i needn't learn this stuff,
   and it would have taken much longer if that were true. so a more
   realistic approximation is learning how to guide someone without
   resources but with independent drive to learn this stuff to have
   an experiment playground and be able to express their creativity
   through the web.</p>

   <h2>day one</h2>
   <p>everything always starts with an email address. one thing
   about library computers is that their public IP addresses can
   have really low reputation, or else be used to sign up for many
   accounts in the free providers (which also triggers anti-bot
   stuff), so it can be a bit of a dice roll when registering
   accounts. i used protonmail: it's free and easy, and gives
   some space in their drive.</p>

   <p>next, i signed up for gitlab and github. the idea is to
   have some space in git repos to put code, and to use the free
   tier ci/cd to do deployments. signing up for both essentially
   doubles the quotas there and they can serve as a backup space
   with private repos.</p>

   <p>i also signed up for cloudflare. their workers are where
   i plan to write any code that requires server-side compute.
   this was one of the first stumbling blocks of the project:
   wrangler. i need to use their tool to interact with most of
   their api and sdk and it's not like i can run a docker
   or random node.js packages from the library's windows computer.</p>

   <p>so the next step was to find somewhere where i can get a
   basic shell that has npm or that i can stick npm in.</p>

   <p>at first i tried jslinux and its sister at copy.sh.
   although these tools do give you a linux shell (and root),
   they are painfully slow (more on that in a sec), and the
   network access is seriously limited: there's a websocket
   proxy but it is capped at 20kB/s which means even if you
   can get npm in (copy.sh has a node.js docker container in
   its archlinux distro), you can't run <pre><code>npm i</code></pre>
   because it simply takes too long to get and uncompress
   all the dependencies.</p>
